                    <h2>UI/UX Design and Development Intern</h2>
                    <p>Duration: December 2020 - May 2021</p>
                    <p>I worked with the main team in charge of creating the User Interfaces for all of Epic Lanka Technologiesâ€™ products. 
                    I was in charge of working with the team to fine tune designs created by senior engineers and communicating with 
                    business analysts in order to truly find the essence of what the application is set to achieve, by using design tools 
                    such as Figma and Adobe Photoshop. Furthermore, I was also given the responsibility of developing certain components 
                    of the Web Applications and Mobile Applications made as part of projects carried out by the company using AngularJS.
